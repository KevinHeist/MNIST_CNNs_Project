# MNIST_CNNs_Project
Using the MNIST data set we compared 3 different CNN: AlexNet, LeNet-5, VGG11.
All 3 models were trained and created to best be applied to the MNIST dataset.
Their performances were analyzed and can be seen in the various excel sheets attached in this repository. 
Each models' performances and tendencies to get each particular digit wrong was also examined.
Finding can be seen in the report to be attached into this directory.

Utilized libraries/packages: NumPy, PyTorch, SciKit-Learn, MatPlotlib
